          Nepal’s historic transition to federalism has surged the demand for
          more and better data. There is an increasing need to transform
          existing data into actionable insights and policy outcomes. To achieve
          this Nepalis – across all the sectors – must have access to and
          ability to use the available data. Bearing this in mind, the World
          Bank is working to propel the data sharing and using capacity of wider
          population, and in the end, optimize the value of data.
